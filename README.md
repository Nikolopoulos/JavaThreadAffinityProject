# JavaThreadAffinityProject
So apparently JAVA fucking SUCKS at thread affinity, to the point that it doesn't support it. Many people have tried to tackle this but they fail because they do not use github in order to include all their libraries. This is a test, that may fail, that tries to tackle this issue by creating one single project that solves this issue. Cheers queers
